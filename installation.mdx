Use the CLI to preview your documentation locally as you write and edit. View changes in real-time before deploying, test your documentation site's appearance and functionality, and catch issues like broken links or accessibility problems.

The CLI also has utilities for maintaining your documentation, including commands to rename files, validate OpenAPI specifications, and migrate content between formats.

## Install the CLI

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v19 or higher.
</Info>

Install the CLI by running one of the following commands in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```

```bash pnpm  
pnpm add -g mint
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mint
```

```bash bun
bun add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

Run `mint --version` to confirm the installation was successful.

## Create a new project

<Tip>
  If you already have a documentation project, skip this section and jump to [Local development](#local-development).
</Tip>

To create a new documentation project with the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
mint new
```

This command creates a new folder for your documentation project with the following structure:

```
my-docs/
├── docs.json
├── index.mdx
├── quickstart.mdx
└── introduction.mdx
```

### Flags

You can customize the project creation process with the following flags:

<ResponseField name="--org-id" type="string">
  The organization ID to associate with the project. Find your organization ID in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) under **Settings** → **Organization**.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--docs-directory" type="string" default=".">
  The directory to create the documentation project in.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--project-name" type="string">
  The name of the project. This will be used as the folder name and the default site title.
</ResponseField>

#### Example with flags

```bash
mint new --org-id="your-org-id" --project-name="My Documentation" --docs-directory="./docs"
```

## Local development

To run a local development server and preview your documentation, navigate to the directory containing your `docs.json` file and run:

```bash
mint dev
```

By default, the development server runs on `localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to preview your documentation.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/installation/local-development-preview-light.png"
    alt="Local development preview"
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/installation/local-development-preview-dark.png"
    alt="Local development preview"
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

The development server automatically reloads when you make changes to your documentation files, so you can see your updates in real-time.

### Environment variables

You can pass environment variables to the development server by creating a `.env` file in your documentation directory.

For example, if your documentation uses API calls that require authentication, you can store your API keys in the `.env` file:

```.env
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourservice.com
```

These variables will be available in your MDX files and custom components during development.

<Warning>
  Environment variables are only available during local development. For production builds, you'll need to configure environment variables in your deployment platform.
</Warning>

### Flags

The `mint dev` command supports the following flags:

<ResponseField name="--port" type="number" default="3000">
  The port to run the development server on.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--host" type="string" default="localhost">
  The host to run the development server on. Use `0.0.0.0` to make the server accessible from other devices on your network.
</ResponseField>

#### Example with flags

```bash
mint dev --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Additional CLI commands

The CLI includes additional utilities for maintaining your documentation:

### Validate your documentation

Check your documentation for common issues like broken links, missing images, and invalid configuration:

```bash
mint validate
```

### Install dependencies

Automatically install the required dependencies for your documentation project:

```bash
mint install
```

### Generate OpenAPI documentation

Generate MDX files from an OpenAPI specification:

```bash
mint generate-openapi [path-to-openapi-file]
```

### Version information

Check which version of the CLI you're running:

```bash
mint --version
```

### Help

View available commands and options:

```bash
mint --help
```

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js version issues

If you encounter issues with the CLI installation or development server, ensure you're using Node.js v19 or higher:

```bash
node --version
```

If you need to upgrade Node.js, visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to download the latest version.

### Permission issues

If you get permission errors during installation, you may need to use `sudo` (on macOS/Linux) or run your terminal as an administrator (on Windows):

```bash
sudo npm i -g mint
```

Alternatively, configure npm to install global packages in a different directory that doesn't require elevated permissions.

### Port conflicts

If port 3000 is already in use, the CLI will automatically try to find an available port. You can also specify a different port using the `--port` flag:

```bash
mint dev --port 8080
```

### Missing docs.json

The CLI looks for a `docs.json` file in the current directory. If you get an error about a missing configuration file, ensure you're running the command from the correct directory or that your `docs.json` file exists and is properly formatted.
